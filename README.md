## Project Description 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on the fitness and well being of the worldwide population. A vital step in tackling the COVID-19 is a successful screening of patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography. This study aims to automatically identify patients with COVID-19 pneumonia using digital x-ray images of the chest while increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis using Convolution Neural networks
(CNN). In this study, CNN based model have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patients using chest X-ray radiography and gives a classification accuracy of 93.77% (training accuracy of 99.81% and validation accuracy of 95.45%).

## Dataset 
The Kaggle dataset was obtained by a team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors. The dataset consists of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images.
</br>
The dataset contains 5380 radiography images divided into four categories: Covid-19, Lung Opacity, Normal, and Pneumonia. Each category contains 1345 images. For the evaluation, we split the images in a 6:2:2 ratio for the train/test/validation set per category.
